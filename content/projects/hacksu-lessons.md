title: Lessons at HacKSU
---

Over the course of three semesters, I gave lessons on coding at HacKSU, Kent State University's premier computer science student organization.

I've always enjoyed creative writing that takes practical, technical subjects that could easily be boring to read about and makes them oddly enthralling - writing like [Joel Spolsky's old blog about software](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2008/03/17/martian-headsets/), or Matt Levine's finance column, [Money Stuff](https://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters/money-stuff). I tried to do the same thing during my time at [HacKSU](https://hacksu.com/), where I was the official "lesson master" during my first semester before becoming the club president for the next two.

HacKSU ended up defining my experience at Kent State to a large degree, and presented a lot of interesting challenges: I ended up being in charge of reconstituting the club's leadership from scratch at the beginning of the 2023-2024 academic year, and hopefully guided it towards being both a forum for technical meetings of the minds and a hub for social activity in the computer science department for the first time since the pandemic started. We covered [a variety](https://hacksu.com/meetings) of useful programming topics and stayed late and talked with quite a few visitors from the software industry.

I started by putting a lot of work into the lessons that I gave, though. Occasionally building on examples created by earlier leaders, I carefully wrote out my thoughts on [basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript](https://github.com/hacksu/HTML-CSS/tree/bd9b4c6aa92654ce196dcbd9e6933e7ff273ee45), [Python](https://github.com/hacksu/How-To-Python/tree/163e8c3d929123cd73bd8e166c5129287855fb4e), [SQLite](https://github.com/hacksu/Python-SQL-Lesson/tree/acee0e62421c1574efbe4e0325479b969976fb09), [Express](https://github.com/hacksu/express-guestbook/tree/0c2ba2498e548643020d54dceae73e87639a7cb7), [MongoDB](https://github.com/hacksu/pokemongo/tree/44abc55e4f35748d0218a0847b6592a56e6b02c0), [React](https://github.com/hacksu/react-tutorial/tree/b0264a2e1938043f764b567783bb38662afac07b), [Vue](https://github.com/hacksu/the-modern-web-via-vue/tree/5f017bba8ab5a565704b68fac682ac4c23aba2e8), [Flutter](https://github.com/hacksu/flutter-app-lesson/tree/a1538c6ef1921bdaf6fdd19a8c612f6b0954d160), and [the fossil record of computer science](https://github.com/hacksu/fossil-record/tree/7db7a7da2c0a1e5e49eead9c9a75a1d717d0ff53), eventually hammering out a little over 30,000 words (about the same length as the book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) - plus about 2,500 more for the [guide to hackathons](https://khe.io/guide) that I wrote when we [organized a hackathon](https://kent-hack-enough-2024.devpost.com/). The format of these lessons is typically a fairly basic, gentle introduction, but I enjoyed using language to illuminate and sometimes re-derive the things that programmers take for granted in the technology stacks we use.
