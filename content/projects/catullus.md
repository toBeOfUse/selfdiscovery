image_alt: '"Catullus, it’s too bad, but don’t be silly/you see it’s gone; well, gone is gone, that’s all" in normal text. "[A deep shuddering inhale] My new thing is infinite resignation./I’m extremely reserved now, and just, I hold everything loosely" in text that''s fading as it gets further from the mouse cursor.'

After stumbling across both Frank O. Copley's modernist translation of the ancient Roman poet Catullus and Daniel Lavery's contemporary take, I wanted to display them in contrast with each other, and ended up spending hours poring over fonts. The end result is a hopefully intriguing grasp for how existing and even ancient texts can be added to by interactivity.
