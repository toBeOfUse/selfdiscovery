image_alt: '"Catullus, it’s too bad, but don’t be silly/you see it’s gone; well, gone is gone, that’s all" in normal text. "[A deep shuddering inhale] My new thing is infinite resignation./I’m extremely reserved now, and just, I hold everything loosely" in text that''s fading as it gets further from the mouse cursor.'

After stumbling across both Frank O. Copley's [modernist translation](https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/7OFnjgEACAAJ?hl=en) of the ancient Roman poet Catullus and Daniel Lavery's [contemporary take](https://www.thechatner.com/p/dirtbag-catullus), I wanted to display them in contrast with each other, and ended up spending hours poring over fonts.

This web page was developed and built using Vue and its command-line interface. Although I wasn't going for this at the time, the result is something like the ubiquitous Unix diff, with similar lines displayed next to each other so that you can see the changes. The font sizes are carefully adjusted with variables in SCSS to keep everything visually at one scale, and the line heights are specified absolutely to prevent layout shift when switching fonts.
