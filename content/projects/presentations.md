image_alt: two browsers open side by side. a mouse goes from one to the other, clicking "next" and "previous" buttons, checking a "laser pointer" checkbox, and waving itself over some slides. when one browser goes to the next or previous slide, so does the other, and the laser point is synchronized between both browsers.

At the beginning of the pandemic, during the Spring 2020 semester, when all my classes went online, we who were in them were stuck giving group presentations remotely, which meant constantly saying "next slide, please" to the one person who was actually sharing their screen. I built this app out of simple JS and HTML with a Python backend to make group control of a presentation seamless; it allowed my group members to connect to my server application (I was using my home IP address and port forwarding to use my regular computer as the server at that time) and synchronized the presentation state between all of our browsers while giving all of us the ability to change it by going back and forth in the slides or by using our cursor to set the position of a laser pointer sprite. It worked! This was possibly the most straightforward and effective problem-solving of my entire programming career.
