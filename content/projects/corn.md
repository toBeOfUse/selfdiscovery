I wanted to make a video game-adjacent interactive 3D graphics project, so I created a website that simulates the experience of eating a cob of corn. One kernel at the time. It was interesting to come up with a control scheme that emulated how one would hold an ear of corn, i.e. one that involves no rotation along the depth axis.
