A long time ago, [I read](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/12/01/craftsmanship-2/) that coding is fundamentally a design process. That stuck in my head, so I eventually decided to develop a theory of what it meant.<!--more--> There are a lot of sub-regions of the software engineering world that are explicitly about design processes: object-oriented design, database systems design (at least, that's what a class I took was called), user interface design; the term somehow suffices to unite all these different subject areas from up and down the stack. For a better look at it, we can simply move over to the seemingly unconnected field of graphic design: imagine someone sitting down to knock out a wedding invitation somewhere.
