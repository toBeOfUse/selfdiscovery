You cannot divide by 0.

I used to think of this as only like, technically true. It's clear that if you divide 10 (for example) by a really small number (like 0.01) you get a big number (like 1000) and if you keep dividing by smaller and smaller numbers (perhaps going 0.001, 0.0001, 0.0000001) the result keeps getting bigger (10000, 100000, 100000000). This process of smaller divisors yielding larger results continues indefinitely, suggesting that dividing by a number that's basically 0 will yield a number that's basically infinity; I thus figured that for all practical purposes 10/0 _was_ infinity. What I didn't realize is that it's just as valid to try to figure out what dividing by 0 yields by dividing 10 by -0.001, -0.0001, and -0.0000001. This is also a way to get to "basically 0;" and getting closer and closer to 0 from this side of the number line gets you larger and larger negative numbers, so you should theoretically end up with negative infinity. You can see this just by graphing y=10/x:
