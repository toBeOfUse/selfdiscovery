    <!-- this next div creates the first content area, which is an "island" that
    contains the summary and navigation elements. it is displayed in the left
    column on desktop, and above the "real" content on mobile.

    on desktop, this uses position: sticky so that it takes up horizontal space
    in the layout, but it's always positioned with its top edge at the top of
    the viewport (and, due to its height, its bottom edge at the bottom of the
    viewport). it thus can vertically center its "island" contents within the
    viewport. -->
