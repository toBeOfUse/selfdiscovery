Eventually, after developing several projects, I decided to create this website in their honor. This site was created and statically generated with Nuxt. It makes extensive use of the Nuxt Content plugin to display posts written in Markdown within Vue components. It is styled with Tailwind CSS. The design for the logo on the front page was created by my friend Hannah.
