Eventually, after developing several projects, I decided to create this website in their honor. This site was created and statically generated with Astro. It uses Astro's content and framework integrations to display posts written in Markdown within Vue components. It is styled with Tailwind CSS. It uses [this](https://free3d.com/3d-model/electronic-display-typewriter-brother-ml-300-3d-model-2863.html) typewriter model for the "projects" graphic. The design for the logo on the front page was created by my friend Hannah.
