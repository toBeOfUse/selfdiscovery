Eventually, after developing several projects, I decided to create this website in their honor. This site was created and statically generated with Astro. It uses Astro's content and framework integrations to integrate posts written in Markdown and Vue components. It is styled with Tailwind CSS. It uses [this](https://free3d.com/3d-model/electronic-display-typewriter-brother-ml-300-3d-model-2863.html) typewriter model for the ["blog"](/blog) graphic. The design for the logo on the front page was created by my friend Hannah.
