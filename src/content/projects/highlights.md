This page documents a few things I've worked on over the years.

Some highlights:

- At Kent State University, I was president of the student organization [HacKSU](#hacksu-lessons) and built [a couple of websites](#khe-io) for it.
- I created [an online platform](#mitchbot-streams) for watching videos in sync online.
- A [Discord bot I built](#spelling-bee) to play the New York Times Spelling Bee with friends has been used by hundreds of people.
- A long time ago, I helped out with an experimental social network called [Sweet.sh](#sweet-sh).
