In [my post about GIFs](/blog/gif), I pointed out that the creators of the GIF file format [explicitly said](https://www.w3.org/Graphics/GIF/spec-gif89a.txt) that it wasn't meant to be a great format for animations, but since it was widely available in people's browsers, and no-one actually read that spec, it ended up being used for animations all over the place anyway, and now that's all the format is known for. By opening a technological window, and allowing some limited animations to be stored in .gif files, they closed a door (new file formats with more advanced compression are constantly pushed back on because people are used to GIFs.)

Unrelatedly, let's look at two keywords in JavaScript: `const` and `let`. `let` creates a variable that can have a new value assigned to it later, while `const` creates a variable that will always have the same value attached to it. The latter is the typical way that people declare variables in modern JavaScript; thanks largely to linting rules and style guides like [the Airbnb JavaScript style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript), which for whatever reason was very popular back in the day, a generation of programmers learned that changing the values of variables was to be avoided, and obviously `const` is the way to do that, right?

If you've programmed much in JavaScript, though, you know that the keyword `const` is misleading. Technically, in a high-falutin' referential identity sense, `const` variables can never have a new value attached to them, but, everything about any object or array that's assigned to a `const` variable can be completely and totally changed at your whim. In other words, altering `const` variables' values is often trivial and the whole keyword is kind of a lie. In other languages, like C++, it is difficult to change data that is attached to a `const` variable; in JavaScript, it's pretty easy, probably because the keyword `const` was not originally part of the language and was only shoved in later.

Who added `let` and `const` to the language? What do they have to say about this inevitable source of confusion for newcomers and sane people? At least in some cases, apologies:

![A series of tweets from Dave Herman, from September 2020, reading: "JS added const to signify binding constants. Since it’s a permissive dynlang it doesn’t fully enforce this meaning, only dynamically enforcing the *variable* doesn’t get reassigned, not that the *value* is immutable. People use it with wild abandon to bind mutable values." "They claim you should use const by default unless you need to reassign a variable. As if whether a variable is locally reassigned is an important thing to be explicit about." "And it fills me with eternal regret as a JS committee member, for adding unenforced const to the language, inviting this unnecessary confusion and fragmentation to the ecosystem."](../../../assets/posts/let-vs-const/unenforced.jpg)

Dave Herman, who was part of the TC39 committee that standardized ES6, which is the version of JavaScript that added `let` and `const`, has a lot of feelings about how things ended up. Here's a few of them:

![A tweet by Shannon Miller reading: "Here is a beautiful hill. Quote tweet this with the pettiest argument that would make you gladly die on this hill." Dave Herman replies: "JS `const` should never be used for anything but constants. Using `const` to mean the variable happens not to be reassigned makes your code less readable, not more."](../../../assets/posts/let-vs-const/hill.jpg)

![Dave Herman quoting a deleted tweet, adding the text "At least she doesn't subscribe to that hipster "use const for everything" thing", with the follow-up tweet "I have this funny idea that const stands for const-ant but what do I know I don't make the rules oh wait I do"](../../../assets/posts/let-vs-const/rules.jpg)

A [lot](https://x.com/search?q=from%3Alittlecalculist%20const&src=typed_query) of feelings. I'm pretty sure, at least among the subset of TC39 members that yap about it, that the original intent was not for `const` to be the default variable declaration keyword in JavaScript. I think that the argument is pretty straightforward: In languages like C++, `const` is useful because the compiler will prevent you from altering any data that's assigned to a `const` variable, which lets you set rules about which data is alterable and which isn't. In JavaScript, though, `const` doesn't work like that; since values assigned to `const` variables can still be altered, all it can really do is send a signal to anyone reading the code that you think that those values _shouldn't_ be altered. Except, if you use `const` by default, that signal is diluted to the point of meaningless, because it'll also be used for variables that store objects or arrays that do, in fact, get altered, because of the original problem: `const` doesn't really mean what it says it means.

Nevertheless, possibly out of misplaced nostalgia for more rigorous programming languages' semantics, `const` is now used everywhere, even though it only kind of means what it means. By opening a window (letting people use `const` to kind-of make variables constant, but not really), the TC39 committee closed a door (there's now no way for a programmer to signal that a variable really shouldn't be altered, because `const` is used for everything, including objects and arrays that _do_ get altered.)

Is this a bad thing? Honestly, the right answer is probably not to care. With a lot of this kind of programming language minutiae, doing the "right thing" isn't actually that different or helpful; my opinion is often that, even when a rule like this is technically correct, it's probably not important enough to add error squiggles to an IDE window over. Every niche subjects has tiny little battles over stuff like this: writers argue about said-bookism, and photographers compare the bokeh of different lenses, even though being right about either thing doesn't change a bad book or photo into a good one.

It's interesting to look at programming language decisions from an adversarial mindset, though, and say: "If we add this to our language, how will programmers misuse it?" Go is a programming language that has been consistently in demand for a while now, probably due at least in part to its enticing simplicity, wherein things like the ternary operator (the `?`) just don't exist. The reason it's missing? According to the language's [official FAQ](https://go.dev/doc/faq#Does_Go_have_a_ternary_form), it's because "the language's designers had seen the operation used too often to create impenetrably complex expressions." It seems likely that the only way to prevent programmers from using language features in ways you don't expect is not to include them at all.
